      <li>What prediction are you willing to stake money on? (<a href="http://example.com/TODO">how to write good bets</a>) <textarea style="width: 100%">By 2021-08-01, will at least 50% of U.S. COVID-19 cases be B117 or a derivative strain, as reported by the CDC?</textarea></li>

        How much would you be willing to pay if your most well-informed friend offered you an IOU that paid out $100 if...
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0">...this <strong>happened?</strong> $<input type="number" style="width: 5em" value=80 /></li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0">...this <strong>didn't happen?</strong> $<input type="number" style="width: 5em" value=10 /></li>
        </ul>
        In other words, you expect that this is <strong>80-90%</strong> likely.
      <li>How long is this offer open for? <input style="width: 5em" type="number" value="2" min=0 step=1 /> <select><option>weeks</option><option>days</option></select></li>
      <li>When will you know the answer by? <input type="date" value="2021-08-01" /></li>
      <li>Any special rules? (For instance: what might make you consider the market unresolvable/invalid? What would you count as "insider trading"/cheating?)</li>
      <textarea style="width: 100%">If the CDC doesn't publish statistics on this, I'll fall back to some other official organization, like the WHO; failing that, I'll look for journal papers on U.S. cases, and go with a consensus if I find one; failing that, the market is unresolvable.</textarea><br />

      <strong>Spencer's special rules:</strong> If the CDC doesn't publish statistics on this, I'll fall back to some other official organization, like the WHO; failing that, I'll look for journal papers on U.S. cases, and go with a consensus if I find one; failing that, the market is unresolvable. <br/>
