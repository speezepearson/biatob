    <h2>By 2021-08-01, will at least 50% of U.S. COVID-19 cases be B117 or a derivative strain, as reported by the CDC?</h2>

    Spencer assigned this a 80-90% chance, and staked $100. <br />
    
    Market opened 2021-01-09, closes 2021-01-23. <br />
    
    Stake $<input style="width: 5em" type="number" value="99" step="1" /> against Spencer's <strong>$11</strong> that this will resolve Yes? <button>Commit</button><br />
    
    Stake $<input style="width: 5em" type="number" value="25" step="1" /> against Spencer's <strong>$100</strong> that this will resolve No? <button>Commit</button><br />
    
    <strong>Spencer's special rules:</strong> If the CDC doesn't publish statistics on this, I'll fall back to some other official organization, like the WHO; failing that, I'll look for journal papers on U.S. cases, and go with a consensus if I find one; failing that, the market is unresolvable. <br/>

      <li>
        A linked inline image: <br />
        <code>&lt;a href="https://biatob.com/bet/12345&gt;&lt;img style="max-height:1.5ex" src="https://biatob.com/bet/12345/ref.png?fg=000000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> <button>Copy</button> <br />
        Or SVG: <br />
        <code>&lt;svg&gt;&lt;style&gt;a{fill:#008800;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="https://biatob.com/bet/12345/ref.svg"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</code> <button>Copy</button> <br />

        In your writing, this would look like "<svg height=1.5ex viewBox="0 0 130 15"><style>a { fill: #008800 }</style><a href="http://example.com/TODO" x=0 y=13><text text-decoration="underline" x=0 y=13>$100 @ 80-90%</text></a></svg>".

      <li>A boring old link: <br/>

        In your writing, this would look like "<a>[stake $20, 50-60%]</a>"
      </li>
