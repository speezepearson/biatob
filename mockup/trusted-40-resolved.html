    <h2>By 2021-08-01, will at least 50% of U.S. COVID-19 cases be B117 or a derivative strain, as reported by the CDC?</h2>

    Spencer resolved this question <strong>NO</strong>. <br />
    <span style="color:red">You owe Spencer $25, which you staked against his $100.</span> <br />

    <hr />

    Spencer assigned this a 80-90% chance, and staked $100. <br />

    Market opened 2021-01-09, closed 2021-01-23. <br />

    <strong>Spencer's special rules:</strong> If the CDC doesn't publish statistics on this, I'll fall back to some other official organization, like the WHO; failing that, I'll look for journal papers on U.S. cases, and go with a consensus if I find one; failing that, the market is unresolvable. <br/>
