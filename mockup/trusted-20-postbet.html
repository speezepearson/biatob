    <h2>By 2021-08-01, will at least 50% of U.S. COVID-19 cases be B117 or a derivative strain, as reported by the CDC?</h2>

    Spencer assigned this a 80-90% chance, and staked $100. <br />

    Market opened 2021-01-09, closes 2021-01-23. <br />

    Stake $<input style="width: 5em" type="number" value="99" step="1" /> against Spencer's <strong>$11</strong> that this will resolve Yes? <button>Commit</button><br />

    Stake $<input disabled style="width: 5em" type="number" value="0" step="1" /> against Spencer's <strong>$0</strong> that this will resolve No? <button disabled>Commit</button><br />

    <strong>Spencer's special rules:</strong> If the CDC doesn't publish statistics on this, I'll fall back to some other official organization, like the WHO; failing that, I'll look for journal papers on U.S. cases, and go with a consensus if I find one; failing that, the market is unresolvable. <br/>

    <strong>Your stake:</strong> if the market resolves Yes, you owe Spencer $25; if No, Spencer owes you $100.
